<p>Trackday Booking is structured like common car-sharing platforms. Our registered users can:</p>

<ul type="square">
	<li>offer free slots for their own testing or track day event ("offer") or</li>
	<li>find others with the same booking interest and book together ("request").</li>
</ul>

<p>The booking itself is directly managed between both parties. The filter functions below can be used to find the Circuit Sharing entries that work best for you. Please note that the menu "Circuit" only shows those circuits that are currently offered or requested by our clients.</p>

<p>See our <a href="/en/frequently-asked-questions">FAQ</a> for further information.</p>
