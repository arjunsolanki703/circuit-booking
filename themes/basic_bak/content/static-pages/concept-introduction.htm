<p>circuit-booking.com is more than just a booking platform and search engine for customers who are planning to book a circuit for any kind of track activities. It also provides a very powerful Calendar Management System to be used mainly by circuit operators free of charge.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this system can also be used by major car manufacturers and event agencies for an inter-company-exchange of booked track days between different departments, being responsible for i.e. motor sport, driving incentives and car launches.</p>
