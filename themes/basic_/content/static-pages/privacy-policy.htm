<p>100% protection against unauthorized access in the case of data transfers across the internet or a website cannot be guaranteed, but we and our service providers and business partners do our utmost to protect your personal data in line with the prevailing data protection regulations by means of physical, electronic, and process-oriented security precautions in line with the current state of the art.

<h2>6. How long do we keep your data?</h2>

<p>In line with article 17 of the basic EU data protection regulations, we will keep your data only as long as necessary for the respective purposes for which we process your data. If we process data for a number of purposes, they are automatically deleted or stored in a format that does not permit conclusions to be drawn directly as regards your person as soon as the last specific task has been performed. To ensure that all of your data are deleted in line with the principle of data minimization and article 17 of the basic EU data protection regulations, HTA has created an internal deletion concept. The fundamental principles by which this deletion concept envisages the deletion of your personal data are described below.</p>

<h2>7. Use for compliance with a contract</h2>

<p>To comply with contractual obligations, data acquired from you can be kept for as long as the contract is in force and - depending on the nature and scope of the contract - for 6 or 10 years beyond this point in order to comply with legal requirements for preservation and to ensure clarification of any queries or claims after the end of the contract.</p>

<h2>8. Use for the assessment of claims</h2>

<p>Data that in our opinion will be necessary to assess and avert claims against us or to initiate criminal proceedings or assert claims against you, us or third parties can be kept by us for as long as corresponding proceedings could be initiated.</p>

<h2>9. Use for customer care</h2>

<p>For customer care, the data acquired from you can be kept for 3 to 10 years, unless you wish to have these data deleted and there are no contractual or legal requirements for preservation that prevent this request for deletion.</p>

<h2>10. Whom do we grant international access to your data and how do we ensure protection?</h2>

<p>Personal data are processed by HTA employees, and by service providers we have commissioned, preferably within the EU.</p>

<p>If data are processed in countries outside of the EU, HTA uses EU standard contracts, including suitable technical and organizational measures, to ensure that your personal data are processed at the same level as European data protection.</p>

<p>In some countries outside the EU, for example Canada and Switzerland, the EU has already determined a level of data protection comparable with that in Europe. The comparable level of data protection means that data transfer into these countries does not require any special permission or agreement.</p>

<h2>11. Contact with us, your data privacy protection rights, and your right to file complaints with data privacy protection authorities</h2>

<p>If you have any questions regarding the use of your personal data by us, it is best to use the contact form.</p>

The next time this website is opened with the same user device, the cookie and the information stored in it is either sent back to the website that created it (first-party cookie) or sent to another website it belongs to (third-party cookie).
